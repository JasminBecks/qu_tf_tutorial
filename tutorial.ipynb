    "\n",
    "However, this process can have some caveats! When the amount of available training examples is very limited, chances are that they might not describe underlying probability distributions with sufficient precision. As a result, the NN might start to develop a bias towards this particular set of examples. Then, after the training phase, when the NN is requested to evaluate examples that it never *saw* before, its ability to infer predictions might differ greatly from what you observed during training. The model fails to **generalize**, which is referred to as **overtraining**."

    "The curves above are produced by scanning potential values to cut on the network output and examining the resulting signal classification (true positive) and background mis-classification (false positive) rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, a well performing network has a high true positive rate while keeping the (reciprocal) false positive rate at a reasonably low (high) level. For the choice of the axes above, this would lead to a curve that is bent towards the upper right corner. But be aware that other representations of the ROC curve exist which might look somewhat different (e.g. \"1 - false positive rate\" on the y-axis). Their message is, however, identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used proxy that compiles the values for all possible cuts into one metric is the area-under-curve - **AUC**. A value of 1 signalizes a perfectly working network that allows for a cut value leading to 100% signal efficiency and 0% background contamination. Opposed to that, a value of 0.5 means that the two output distributions of signal and background events are probably fully overlapping, lacking the opportunity to apply a cut that would favor signal examples. A value of 0 has the same logical meaning as 1, but the definition of what is signal and background is flipped. Therefore, the distance from 0.5 is what actually matters here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A value around 0.75 is already quite decent, but there's still potential. You can try to beat this value in the full training setup below."

The content of `t` - not that many bytes in this example, but tensors can easily reach a couple MBs - is transferred to the GPU, together with the instructions to multiply each value by 2 and then adding 1.

As we have seen in the plots above, their numerical values range from -500 to 500 for $p_x$ and $p_y$, and up to 2000 for $E$ and $p_z$ values. We can use the abstract term *application domain* to describe these ranges. \n",

    "However, the domain of numbers being passed back and forth through the network is entirely different and can even vary depending on the architecture you pick! A classical feed forward network, such as the one we created above, and a plentora of techniques that were developed throughout the last decade(s) prefer values to be in a range between, say, -1 and 1, and we can call it *network domain*. This is just an example and somewhat larger values are certainly fine as well. But still, you get the idea that numerical application and network domains are *entirely different*.\n",

    "Networks can be used for more than one purpose at the same time. Although it is always an option to develop one model for each particular use case, it might be beneficial to rely on a single, multi-purpose network.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the power of a model to make predictions depends on its ability to extract useful information from input data. This entails the discovery of inner symmetries in usually complex data (physics relations in our case) as well as of (high-dimensional) regions in the phase space that separate between signal and background. Two tasks might require their networks to exploit its input data in a similar fashion, so having a common part seems very natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, training two separate networks for two different purposes provides no handle to control the correlation between their particular outputs. For instance, given the same input example, one network might be able to predict a physics quantity very precisely, while an other network struggles at its specific task. However, given the feedback of the loss function through backpropagation, the training target is actually another source of information that a network eventually exploits. Therefore, the presence of a second training target in the loss function can actually influence the performance to predict the initial target, and this is what we are going to do in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just classifying a jet as either a top or a light jet, we include a regression task, i.e., the prediction of a real physics quantity. For all true top jets, we want to learn the energy of the initial particle that caused the jet. For light jets, we want this energy to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We achieve this by definining a network part that is common to both tasks, as well as two dedicated sets of densely connected layers. The output of these two parts are stacked, resulting in a total of three output nodes: two classification outputs (light-jet-like, top-jet-like) and one regression output (the energy). For the combined loss function, this implies that we need to introduce another hyper-parameter (`reg_norm`) to balance the regression loss with respect to the classification loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds easy so far, but in fact, there is an issue! As we've seen above, the target energy values span a range from 0 to approximately 2500 GeV. Using the terms introduced above, this numerical *application domain* is not compatible with the *network domain*, so another scaling is required. When doing so, the network is constructed to predict the scaled value which is then manually re-scaled to obtain a value that we *interpret* as an energy."
